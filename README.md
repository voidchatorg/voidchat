# Voidchat: Anonymous Random Chat With Strangers

Voidchat is an anonymous chat platform that doesnâ€™t require registration or an account. You can match with random strangers based on interests (similar to Omegle) or create your own chat room, which you can personalize with custom CSS, backgrounds and more.
